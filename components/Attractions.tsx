                                      According to legend, the Buddha intervened to end a dispute between two Naga (serpent) kings, father-in-law and son, who were vying for possession of a gem-studded throne.
                                      As a result of the Buddha's intervention, harmony was restored, and peace prevailed.

As visitors approach the temple, they are greeted by the serene ambiance and the rich scent of incense.

Adjacent to the Buddhist temple, there stands a prominent Hindu Kovil dedicated to Skanda, the son of Lord Shiva.
